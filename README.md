# moris-rafoul-26-07-2020 - frontend
https://moris-rafoul-26-07-2020.netlify.app/

## Important Notes 
- this project was made in a week alongside the backend project [(link to the backend project)](https://github.com/MorisR/moris-rafoul-26-07-2020-backend)
- this is my first time ever using "material ui", I had to learn it on the spot and master it in 1~2 days
- I've tried my best to make the code as mush user friendly as I could within the given time frame, 
    - although tbh to me it still feels like a mess..
    - I’m still trying to figure out the best strategy for it. 
- I came across some difficulties in hosting the app because initially I used proxy to forward the api calls to the backend, 
which gave me plenty of problems to deal with afterwards (cooikies not being passed/diffrant hosting services giving diffrant results/ etc...)
- **I can't deny that I am still a joiner developer, I'm still learning ( from mistakes, from the experience, trial and error, etc...)**
- **I would really like the opportunity to grow and gain more experience, I’m willing to put in the effort, give it whatever it takes!**

### Installation
1) clone the repo 
2) install dependencies by running 
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3) add .env file to the root of the project
    - you can do that by renaming the ".env_template" file in the root directory to ".env" and filling in the correct values
    - read [".env file"](https://github.com/MorisR/moris-rafoul-26-07-2020-backend/issues/25) for more info about the values and purpose of each field
4) start the server running the following command
    ```
    npm start
    ```
